ngLoggly is a module which will decorate Angular's $log service, and provide a
LogglyLogger service which can be used to manually send messages of any kind to
loggly.

# Getting Started

ngLoggly can be installed with bower:

```
bower install angular-loggly-logger
```

Once configured (by including "ngLoggly" as a module dependency), the $log
service will automatically be decorated, and all messages logged will be handled
as normal as well as formated and passed to LogglyLogger.sendMessage.

To use both the decorated $log and the LogglyLogger service, you must first
configure it with an inputToken, which is done via the LogglyLoggerProvider:

```
angular.module( 'myApp', ['ngLoggly'] )

  .config( function( LogglyLoggerProvider ) {
    LogglyLoggerProvider.inputToken( '<loggly input token here>' );
  } );
  
  .run( function( LogglyLogger, $log ) {
    
    //This will be sent to both the console and Loggly
    $log.info( "I'm a little teapot." );
    
    //This will be sent to loggly only
    LogglyLogger.sendMessage( 'Short and Stout.' )
  }

```

# $log decoration

When sent through the `$log` decorator, messages will be formatted as follows:
```

// Example: $log.warn( 'Danger! Danger!' );
{ 
  level: "WARN",
  timestamp: "2014-05-01T13:10Z",
  msg: "Danger! Danger!",
  url: "https://github.com/ajbrown/angular-loggly-logger/demo/index.html",
}

// Example: $log.debug( 'User submitted something:', { foo: 'A.J', bar: 'Space' } )

{ 
  level: "DEBUG",
  timestamp: "2014-05-01T13:18Z",
  msg: ["User submitted something", { foo: 'A.J.', bar: 'Space' }],
  url: "https://github.com/ajbrown/angular-loggly-logger/demo/index.html",
}
```

> However, 'url' and 'timestamp' are not included by default.  You must enable those options in your application config (see below).


Note that if you do not call `LogglyLoggerProvider.inputToken()` in a config method, messages will not be sent to loggly.  At the moment, there is no warning -- your message is just ignored.

# Configuration 

The following configuration options are available.

```
  LogglyLoggerProvider
  
    .inputToken( string ) // The token for the input logs will be sent.  If not set, no messages will be sent to loggly.
  
    .useHttps( boolean )  // Requests will be sent over HTTPS if set to true.  Default is true.
  
    .includeUrl( boolean ) // The value of $location.absUrl() will be sent as the "url" key if set to true.  Default is false.
  
    .includeTimestamp( boolean ) // The current timestamp will be included if set to true.  default is false.
  
```

You can also default some "extra/default" information to be sent with each log message.  When this is set, `LogglyLogger` will include the key/values provided with all messages, plus the data to be sent for each specific logging request.

```

  LogglyLoggerProvider.setExtra( { appVersion: 1.1.0, browser: 'Chrome' } );
  
  ...
  
  $log.warn( 'Danger! Danger!' )
  
  >> { appVersion: 1.1.0, browser: 'Chrome', level: 'WARN', msg: 'Danger! Danger', url: 'http://google.com' }
```

Be aware that when using `setExtra` with `LogglyLogger.sendMessage( obj )`, any properties in your `obj` that are the same as your `extra` will be overwritten.  

### TODO

- Support for input [Tags](https://www.loggly.com/docs/tags/)
- Support batching of requests.
- Support session tracking (each client sends an identifier for all logs)
